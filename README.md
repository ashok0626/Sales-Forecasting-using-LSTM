FEATURED TECHNIQUES :

1)EDA
2)Linear Regression

3)Random Forest Regression

4)XGBoost

5)Long Short Term Memory (artifical recurrent neural network

6)ARIMA Time Series Forecasting


RESULTS :

Best results were obtained from the XGBoost and LSTM models

All models predicted within 2% of monthly mean sales for 12 month prediction
